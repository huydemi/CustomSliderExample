# CustomSliderExample

In this tutorial, you will implement your very own RangeSlider custom control. 

This control is like a double-ended slider, where you can pick both a minimum and maximum value. 

You’ll touch on such concepts as:

- extending existing controls, 
- designing 
- and implementing your control’s API, 
- and even how to share your new control with the development community.
